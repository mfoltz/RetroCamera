## Credits

- [ModernCamera](https://github.com/oscarpedrero/BloodyMerchant) by [@Trodi](https://github.com/oscarpedrero) was invaluable in putting this together, many thanks to him and other listed contributors!
- [ModernCameraFix](https://github.com/oscarpedrero/BloodyMerchant) by [@Trodi](https://github.com/oscarpedrero) was invaluable in putting this together, many thanks to him and other listed contributors!
- [Silkworm](https://github.com/oscarpedrero/BloodyMerchant) by [@iZastic](https://github.com/iZastic/vrising-silkworm) Menu option implementation is almost all from Silkworm, with rebinding handled by a coroutine of mine.
- [Bloodstone](https://github.com/oscarpedrero/BloodyMerchant) by [@Trodi](https://github.com/decaprime/Bloodstone) Keybind implementation is mostly informed by Bloodstone (plan on updating that aspect of Bloodstone back to functioning #soon) although I think some Silkworm made it in? Was extremely hard to keep track of at the time which was a large motivation for refactoring.
